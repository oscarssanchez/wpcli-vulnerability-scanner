# WP Vulnerability Scanner

Check WordPress core, installed plugins and themes for vulnerabilities reported by wpvulndb.com.

## Installation

### Global command, automatically
It can be installed as a wp-cli package via git repo which is the most preferred way to install.
```
wp package install git@github.com:10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner.git
```

### VulnDB API Access
Per the VulnDB API documentation, you will need to register for a user account and supply an API token.
Once you have acquired the token, you can add it as a constant in wp-config.php as follows:
```
define( 'VULN_API_TOKEN', 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' );
```


### Global command, manually
Clone this repo, and require `wp-vulnerability-scanner.php` from wp-cli config.

E.g. in `~/.wp-cli/config.yml` [[other config locations](http://wp-cli.org/config/)]

```
require:
  - /path/to/this/repo/wp-vulnerability-scanner.php
```

### Standard plugin
This repo can be installed as a regular plugin. There is no UI, but the command will become available.

```
wp plugin install --activate https://github.com/10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner/archive/master.zip
```

After plugin installation, you can verify the command is in place with `wp help vuln`

## Usage

```
wp vuln status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios
 
```
wp vuln core-status
```
 
 * *Options:*
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios

```
wp vuln plugin-status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--porcelain` Only print slugs of vulnerable plugins with updates
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios
 
```
wp vuln theme-status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--porcelain` Only print slugs of vulnerable theme with updates
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios

### Example usage

**Basic**

```
wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain)
```
Will simply error out if there are no slugs returned by the `plugin-status` command. Can suppress the output by appending ` &> /dev/null` 

```
wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```
**Scheduled/Cron**

```
0 0 * * * wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
0 0 * * * wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```

`0 0 * * *` is everyday at midnight. For assistance creating an alternate schedule, check out [http://crontab.guru/](http://crontab.guru/). For example, `0 0 * * 1,4` runs at midnight every Monday and Thursday.

**With email notifications**

Included is a sample bash script, `includes/vuln.sh`. This can be customized and used in a cron job so that you can be alerted when vulnerabilities are found.

 * `WPCLIPATH` should be the full path to your wp command. The script will attempt to discover this automatically if the given filename does not exist

 * `RECIPIENT` should be an email address which will receive the notifications
 * `SUBJECT` is the email subject

This readme does not discuss configuring the `mail` command on your server. To run a simple test, try 

```
echo "This is the body text" | mail -s "Email subject" you@domain.com

```

**Nagios**

`wp vuln plugin-status --nagios` will give output for Nagios monitoring.

## Check uninstalled themes and plugins

Check a specific version of a theme or plugin. Example:

```
wp vuln theme-check twentyfifteen --version=1.1
```

Or check several at once (cannot accept versions)

```
wp vuln plugin-check wppizza wordpress-seo
```
